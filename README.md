### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Currently working on/maintaining <strong>[npwd](https://github.com/project-error/npwd), [error-media](https://media.error-interactive.com/), [guildedgo](https://github.com/itschip/guildedgo)</strong> (probably a few more idk) and other open-source projects that seems interesting and fun to contribute to.
